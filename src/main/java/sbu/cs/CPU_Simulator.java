/*
    For this exercise, you must simulate a CPU with a single core.
    You will receive an arraylist of tasks as input. Each task has a processing
    time which is the time it needs to run in order to fully execute.

    The CPU must choose the task with the shortest processing time and create
    a new thread for it. The main thread should wait for the task to fully
    execute and then join with it, before starting the next task.

    Once a task is fully executed, add its ID to the executed tasks arraylist.
    Use the tests provided in the test folder to ensure your code works correctly.
